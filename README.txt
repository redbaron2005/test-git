Well so far so good...
IF THIS CAN BE SEEN ON GITHUB!
And only if.

--- After following TryGit ---

Wow, that was somewhat easy...
I just needed to stay focused and yeah.
I understand so much more now...
I am currently creating a tutorial of my very own on how to use git, github, and the commands,
This will be based off what I learned on TryGit. Why don't you go a head and click the "Watch" button up there at the top, and keep on eye out for my tut.
